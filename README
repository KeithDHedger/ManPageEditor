I write a number of my own programs, and have always had a bit of a problem writing the manpage, I have used the excellent 'ManEdit' but development on this has been stalled for a number of years.
So I finally decided to write my own and this is the result.

Debian or Ubuntu install.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential 
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev
sudo apt-get install libgtksourceview2.0-dev libaspell-dev

Fedora Install
sudo yum update kernel*
sudo yum install gcc-c++ glib2-devel gtk2-devel gcc
sudo yum install gtksourceview2-devel ctags webkitgtk-devel aspell-devel

To install:
./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-aspell
make
sudo make install

If you don't have aspell installed then don't enable it!

If you have problems importing a manpage or a system manpage try:

GROFF_SGR=1 manpageeditor

You can make this permenant by adding:
export GROFF_SGR=1
To your shell start up files, ~/.bashrc for instance.

Please readd the BUGS-ETC file.
